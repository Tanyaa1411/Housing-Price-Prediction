Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Objective:
To predict house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, location indicators, etc., using a Linear Regression model.

🔍 Project Steps:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Inspected dataset structure and distributions.

Checked for missing values and feature correlations using a heatmap.

Data Preprocessing:

Identified and selected relevant features.

Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Model Building:

Applied Linear Regression using scikit-learn.

Trained model on training data.

Prediction & Evaluation:

Predicted prices on test data.

Evaluated model using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Quantifies average squared prediction errors.

R-squared (R²): Measures how well the model explains variance in house prices.

📈 Tools & Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy for data handling

matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

scikit-learn for regression and metrics

✅ Outcome:
Built a working regression model to estimate housing prices.

Provided insights into how strongly each feature impacts the target (price).

Achieved a performance score based on R² and MSE.
